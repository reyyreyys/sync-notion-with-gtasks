You suddenly hear loud footsteps. Who was it. Or rather, what was it? You have never seen this house before, let alone be in this place in the middle of nowhere. You are struck, confused. But one thing is certain, that is to escape. \n\nThe Escape was the first Virtual Reality project that my partner and I worked on during one of our modules regarding immersive simulation. It was an interactive escape room experience, featuring a house with a monster that dynamically reacts to sound around it! The goal is simple, to escape the house. The key is hidden in one of the many interactable cabinets/drawers in the house and the player has to find the right one. The monster reacts to the movement of the player. While the player has 3 different movement speeds, it varies in level of audio loudness as well which the monster reacts to. Crouching is the slowest form of movement and makes the least noise, while walking is normal speed with standard level of noise and running, which causes the monster to hear you no matter where you are in the house! You can also pick up grabbable items and furniture around the house, throw it on the ground to attract the monster to the location where the item landed. There is a hidden room with a weapon that can be used against the monster as well! There is a time limit of 3 minutes to escape the house and a “Nightmare” difficulty where the speed of the monster is doubled!\n## Edited\n  🎮 The Escape – Our First Virtual Reality Horror Experience 👻🧠\n  Imagine waking up in a house you've never seen before... 🏚️\n  Something feels off. You hear heavy footsteps echoing down the hallway… 🦶💥\n  You don’t know who — or what — it is. But one thing is clear: you need to escape. ⏳🚪\n  The Escape was the first VR project my partner and I developed during a module on immersive simulation. We built an interactive escape room game in Virtual Reality, blending horror, stealth, and tension-driven gameplay — all powered by sound and player movement. 🎧🕹️\n  🔑 Highlights:\n  • 💡 Objective: Find the hidden key and escape the house in under 3 minutes!\n  • 👣 The monster reacts to the player’s noise and movement.\n  • 🐢 Crouch (silent), 🚶 Walk (normal), 🏃 Run (loud!) — each movement speed has different noise levels.\n  • 📦 Pick up and throw objects to distract the monster.\n  • 🔫 Discover a secret weapon hidden in a locked room.\n  • 😱 “Nightmare” difficulty doubles the monster’s speed for extra terror!\n  🛠️ Tools used: Unity, XR Interaction Toolkit, and a lot of trial-and-error creativity! 🛠️🔥\n  This project pushed our boundaries and taught us a lot about designing immersive, reactive environments. Proud to have brought this terrifying idea to life! 🧩\n  Can’t wait to keep exploring the world of immersive tech and game design. 🚀\n  #VRDevelopment #Unity3D #EscapeRoom #GameDesign #ImmersiveTech #StudentProject #VirtualReality #HorrorGames #IndieDev #SoundDesign #XR #TeamWork\n# Snake Ball Z\n## Raw\n  This is the largest VR Project that I have worked on, from the prototype consisting of 4 stages with core gameplay mechanics to a final game with 7 stages, multiple cutscenes and win/death scenario! This game is a VR-based zombie survival shooter that combines action-packed gameplay with iconic elements inspired by the “Dragon Ball” series.  It is a story based game with thrilling action gameplay with different maps and save points.\n  The story goes like this:\n  The story is set in a post-apocalyptic world where Bulma's attempt to create an anti-aging serum results in a deadly zombie virus outbreak. Players take on the roles of “Goku” with his buddy “Vegeta”, tasked with traveling through six different realms to recover the mystical Snake Balls. Only by collecting all six can they confront Beerus, who plans to destroy Earth to contain the zombie threat!\n  The player’s goal is simple, to collect all 7 “Snake Balls” which would allow the player to make a wish that would restore peace to the whole world and restore their powers!\n  The game features advanced gameplay mechanics such as positional tracking for recharging the gun, where the player has to enter a stance where their hands are below their waist, positioned apart from each other, achieving a “Charging Stance” where the gun will be reloaded. The player also has an NPC partner, “Vegeta” that follows them around and helps to shoot the zombies (there is an artificial recoil added to their guns to prevent them from being aimbots). When the player comes into contact with the zombie, they will be trapped and unable to move, they will have to shake their right hand (controller) in order to break free from their grasp. During this state, the player will accumulate damage per second.\n  In further stages, the player is also able to fire special attacks such as the “Kamehameha”, “Galick Gun” or “Final Flash”. These attacks require the player to shout the name of the attack, the gun will then charge up the attack before the player presses the trigger to fire the attack. Any zombie that was hit by the ray of the special attack will accumulate damage.\n  The boss fight features an npc enemy, “Lord Beerus”, which will move towards the player and fire blasts at the player. The boss will also be able to fire special attacks, dealing additional damage.\n  Once the player lowers the boss’ health enough, he can “punch” the boss in the abdomen area, causing the enemy to fall and the ending cutscene will play.\n  I learnt a lot while developing this large game, mainly how the flow of a story focused game would be. We made many changes along the way, including how the “stages” are played, initially, the stages are showed as waves, where the players play each stages to get a “Snake Ball”. However, after thinking back, we realised it was better to have it as save points instead, where players go through different stages as part of a continuous story, with each map being a different part of the story.\n  Going through the prototyping stages to a finalised design has benefitted me in understanding how we can solidify our core gameplay mechanics before polishing the nitty gritty details.\n  Overall been experience. My partner and I have decided on the “Dragon Ball” series as we had nostalgic experience with the series, for me, it was playing the “Shin Budokai” game on my psp a decade ago, while for Long it was watching the series on cable TV during his childhood days.

You suddenly hear loud footsteps. Who was it. Or rather, what was it? You have never seen this house before, let alone be in this place in the middle of nowhere. You are struck, confused. But one thing is certain, that is to escape. \n\nThe Escape was the first Virtual Reality project that my partner and I worked on during one of our modules regarding immersive simulation. It was an interactive escape room experience, featuring a house with a monster that dynamically reacts to sound around it! The goal is simple, to escape the house. The key is hidden in one of the many interactable cabinets/drawers in the house and the player has to find the right one. The monster reacts to the movement of the player. While the player has 3 different movement speeds, it varies in level of audio loudness as well which the monster reacts to. Crouching is the slowest form of movement and makes the least noise, while walking is normal speed with standard level of noise and running, which causes the monster to hear you no matter where you are in the house! You can also pick up grabbable items and furniture around the house, throw it on the ground to attract the monster to the location where the item landed. There is a hidden room with a weapon that can be used against the monster as well! There is a time limit of 3 minutes to escape the house and a “Nightmare” difficulty where the speed of the monster is doubled!\n## Edited\n  🎮 The Escape – Our First Virtual Reality Horror Experience 👻🧠\n  Imagine waking up in a house you've never seen before... 🏚️\n  Something feels off. You hear heavy footsteps echoing down the hallway… 🦶💥\n  You don’t know who — or what — it is. But one thing is clear: you need to escape. ⏳🚪\n  The Escape was the first VR project my partner and I developed during a module on immersive simulation. We built an interactive escape room game in Virtual Reality, blending horror, stealth, and tension-driven gameplay — all powered by sound and player movement. 🎧🕹️\n  🔑 Highlights:\n  • 💡 Objective: Find the hidden key and escape the house in under 3 minutes!\n  • 👣 The monster reacts to the player’s noise and movement.\n  • 🐢 Crouch (silent), 🚶 Walk (normal), 🏃 Run (loud!) — each movement speed has different noise levels.\n  • 📦 Pick up and throw objects to distract the monster.\n  • 🔫 Discover a secret weapon hidden in a locked room.\n  • 😱 “Nightmare” difficulty doubles the monster’s speed for extra terror!\n  🛠️ Tools used: Unity, XR Interaction Toolkit, and a lot of trial-and-error creativity! 🛠️🔥\n  This project pushed our boundaries and taught us a lot about designing immersive, reactive environments. Proud to have brought this terrifying idea to life! 🧩\n  Can’t wait to keep exploring the world of immersive tech and game design. 🚀\n  #VRDevelopment #Unity3D #EscapeRoom #GameDesign #ImmersiveTech #StudentProject #VirtualReality #HorrorGames #IndieDev #SoundDesign #XR #TeamWork\n# Snake Ball Z\n## Raw\n  This is the largest VR Project that I have worked on, from the prototype consisting of 4 stages with core gameplay mechanics to a final game with 7 stages, multiple cutscenes and win/death scenario! This game is a VR-based zombie survival shooter that combines action-packed gameplay with iconic elements inspired by the “Dragon Ball” series.  It is a story based game with thrilling action gameplay with different maps and save points.\n  The story goes like this:\n  The story is set in a post-apocalyptic world where Bulma's attempt to create an anti-aging serum results in a deadly zombie virus outbreak. Players take on the roles of “Goku” with his buddy “Vegeta”, tasked with traveling through six different realms to recover the mystical Snake Balls. Only by collecting all six can they confront Beerus, who plans to destroy Earth to contain the zombie threat!\n  The player’s goal is simple, to collect all 7 “Snake Balls” which would allow the player to make a wish that would restore peace to the whole world and restore their powers!\n  The game features advanced gameplay mechanics such as positional tracking for recharging the gun, where the player has to enter a stance where their hands are below their waist, positioned apart from each other, achieving a “Charging Stance” where the gun will be reloaded. The player also has an NPC partner, “Vegeta” that follows them around and helps to shoot the zombies (there is an artificial recoil added to their guns to prevent them from being aimbots). When the player comes into contact with the zombie, they will be trapped and unable to move, they will have to shake their right hand (controller) in order to break free from their grasp. During this state, the player will accumulate damage per second.\n  In further stages, the player is also able to fire special attacks such as the “Kamehameha”, “Galick Gun” or “Final Flash”. These attacks require the player to shout the name of the attack, the gun will then charge up the attack before the player presses the trigger to fire the attack. Any zombie that was hit by the ray of the special attack will accumulate damage.\n  The boss fight features an npc enemy, “Lord Beerus”, which will move towards the player and fire blasts at the player. The boss will also be able to fire special attacks, dealing additional damage.\n  Once the player lowers the boss’ health enough, he can “punch” the boss in the abdomen area, causing the enemy to fall and the ending cutscene will play.\n  I learnt a lot while developing this large game, mainly how the flow of a story focused game would be. We made many changes along the way, including how the “stages” are played, initially, the stages are showed as waves, where the players play each stages to get a “Snake Ball”. However, after thinking back, we realised it was better to have it as save points instead, where players go through different stages as part of a continuous story, with each map being a different part of the story.\n  Going through the prototyping stages to a finalised design has benefitted me in understanding how we can solidify our core gameplay mechanics before polishing the nitty gritty details.\n  Overall been experience. My partner and I have decided on the “Dragon Ball” series as we had nostalgic experience with the series, for me, it was playing the “Shin Budokai” game on my psp a decade ago, while for Long it was watching the series on cable TV during his childhood days. I have also watched all seasons and series of “Dragon Ball” during the development of this game to ensure the storyline we picked was as close to a canon situation as possible.\n  (This game has been heavily inspired by the franchise “Dragon Ball” series, however, we are not directly associated with the producers of the series)\n## Edited\n  🧟‍♂️ 𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗟𝗮𝗿𝗴𝗲𝘀𝘁 𝗩𝗥 𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗷𝗲𝗰𝘁 𝗜'𝘃𝗲 𝗘𝘃𝗲𝗿 𝗪𝗼𝗿𝗸𝗲𝗱 𝗢𝗻 🔥🎮\n  From a 4-stage prototype focused on core mechanics to a full-fledged 7-stage VR experience — this has been the most ambitious and rewarding project I’ve ever developed.\n  𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗚𝗮𝗺𝗲:\nA VR zombie survival shooter inspired by the Dragon Ball series, blending high-stakes action with story-driven progression.

This game is a VR-based zombie survival shooter that combines action-packed gameplay with iconic elements inspired by the “Dragon Ball” series.  It is a story based game with thrilling action gameplay with different maps and save points.\n  The story goes like this:\n  The story is set in a post-apocalyptic world where Bulma's attempt to create an anti-aging serum results in a deadly zombie virus outbreak. Players take on the roles of “Goku” with his buddy “Vegeta”, tasked with traveling through six different realms to recover the mystical Snake Balls. Only by collecting all six can they confront Beerus, who plans to destroy Earth to contain the zombie threat!\n  The player’s goal is simple, to collect all 7 “Snake Balls” which would allow the player to make a wish that would restore peace to the whole world and restore their powers!\n  The game features advanced gameplay mechanics such as positional tracking for recharging the gun, where the player has to enter a stance where their hands are below their waist, positioned apart from each other, achieving a “Charging Stance” where the gun will be reloaded. The player also has an NPC partner, “Vegeta” that follows them around and helps to shoot the zombies (there is an artificial recoil added to their guns to prevent them from being aimbots). When the player comes into contact with the zombie, they will be trapped and unable to move, they will have to shake their right hand (controller) in order to break free from their grasp. During this state, the player will accumulate damage per second.\n  In further stages, the player is also able to fire special attacks such as the “Kamehameha”, “Galick Gun” or “Final Flash”. These attacks require the player to shout the name of the attack, the gun will then charge up the attack before the player presses the trigger to fire the attack. Any zombie that was hit by the ray of the special attack will accumulate damage.\n  The boss fight features an npc enemy, “Lord Beerus”, which will move towards the player and fire blasts at the player. The boss will also be able to fire special attacks, dealing additional damage.\n  Once the player lowers the boss’ health enough, he can “punch” the boss in the abdomen area, causing the enemy to fall and the ending cutscene will play.\n  I learnt a lot while developing this large game, mainly how the flow of a story focused game would be. We made many changes along the way, including how the “stages” are played, initially, the stages are showed as waves, where the players play each stages to get a “Snake Ball”. However, after thinking back, we realised it was better to have it as save points instead, where players go through different stages as part of a continuous story, with each map being a different part of the story.\n  Going through the prototyping stages to a finalised design has benefitted me in understanding how we can solidify our core gameplay mechanics before polishing the nitty gritty details.\n  Overall been experience. My partner and I have decided on the “Dragon Ball” series as we had nostalgic experience with the series, for me, it was playing the “Shin Budokai” game on my psp a decade ago, while for Long it was watching the series on cable TV during his childhood days. I have also watched all seasons and series of “Dragon Ball” during the development of this game to ensure the storyline we picked was as close to a canon situation as possible.\n  (This game has been heavily inspired by the franchise “Dragon Ball” series, however, we are not directly associated with the producers of the series)\n## Edited\n  🧟‍♂️ 𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗟𝗮𝗿𝗴𝗲𝘀𝘁 𝗩𝗥 𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗷𝗲𝗰𝘁 𝗜'𝘃𝗲 𝗘𝘃𝗲𝗿 𝗪𝗼𝗿𝗸𝗲𝗱 𝗢𝗻 🔥🎮\n  From a 4-stage prototype focused on core mechanics to a full-fledged 7-stage VR experience — this has been the most ambitious and rewarding project I’ve ever developed.\n  𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗚𝗮𝗺𝗲:\nA VR zombie survival shooter inspired by the Dragon Ball series, blending high-stakes action with story-driven progression.

But one thing is certain, that is to escape. \n\nThe Escape was the first Virtual Reality project that my partner and I worked on during one of our modules regarding immersive simulation. It was an interactive escape room experience, featuring a house with a monster that dynamically reacts to sound around it! The goal is simple, to escape the house. The key is hidden in one of the many interactable cabinets/drawers in the house and the player has to find the right one. The monster reacts to the movement of the player. While the player has 3 different movement speeds, it varies in level of audio loudness as well which the monster reacts to. Crouching is the slowest form of movement and makes the least noise, while walking is normal speed with standard level of noise and running, which causes the monster to hear you no matter where you are in the house! You can also pick up grabbable items and furniture around the house, throw it on the ground to attract the monster to the location where the item landed. There is a hidden room with a weapon that can be used against the monster as well!
